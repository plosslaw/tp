## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder.
Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `worker-delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `WorkerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `McSchedulerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a worker).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("worker-delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `worker-delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `WorkerDeleteCommandParser`should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the mcsheduler data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Worker>` and `ObservableList<Role>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/mcscheduler/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the mcscheduler data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `mcscheduler.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Worker feature

The adding of workers is core to the functionality of the system. Users are able to add important information to each
worker, which will help them assign workers to shifts they are most suited for.

#### Implementation

The mechanism for adding a worker is facilitated by a `Worker` class. A `Worker` has a `Name`, a
`Phone`, a `Pay`, an optional `Role` set and an optional `Unavailability` set.

![Worker Class Diagram](images/WorkerClassDiagram.png)

A user can add a `Worker` to the `McScheduler` by running a `worker-add` command. 

#### Example usage scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `worker-add` feature behaves at each step after the user has
launched the application.

Step 1. The user executes the command `worker-add n/John hp/98765432 p/9.0 a/400 Scheduler Lane`. `McSchedulerParser`
creates a `WorkerAddCommandParser` and calls the `WorkerAddCommandParser#parse()` method.

Step 2. The fields `n/`, `hp/`, `p/`, and `a/` are parsed within `WorkerAddCommandParser#parse()` and an instance of
`Name`, `Phone`, `Pay` and `Address` are created respectively. These objects are passed as arguments to the `Worker`
constructor and a new `Worker` object is created.

Step 3. A `WorkerAddCommand` with the created `Worker` object as an argument is returned to the `LogicManager` and
executed. The `Worker` object is added to and stored inside the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram shows how `Worker` is added.

![Add Worker Sequence Diagram](images/AddWorkerSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `WorkerAddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Shift feature

Similar to workers, adding and manipulating shifts is a key functionality of the McScheduler. Users will be able to add
role requirements to shifts, assign workers to shifts and assign workers to take leave for a shift. 

#### Implementation

Shifts are represented by the `Shift` class. It contains important details related to shifts such as the day (through `ShiftDay`),
the time (through `ShiftTime`) and role requirements (through `RoleRequirement`) of the shift. A `RoleRequirement` object
details how many workers are needed to fill which roles in a given shift.

The following diagram details `Shift` and how it is represented in the App model.

![Shift Class Diagram](images/ShiftClassDiagram.png)

#### Commands

The following commands have been implemented to work with `Shift`:
- `ShiftAddCommand` to add new shifts
- `ShiftEditCommand` to edit existing shifts
- `ShiftDeleteCommand` to delete existing shifts

These commands work similarly to the `Worker` based commands.

#### Example usage scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `shift-edit` feature works at each step.

Step 1. User enters the command `shift-edit 2 d/FRI`. `McSchedulerParser` creates a `ShiftEditCommandParser` and calls
the `ShiftEditCommandParser#parser()` method.

Step 2. The preamble index and field `d/` are parsed within `ShiftEditCommandParser#parser()` and creates an instance of
`ShiftEditCommandParser` then creates a `ShiftEditDescriptor` with a new `ShiftDay`. Should there be other optional fields
such as `ShiftTime` or `RoleRequirement` as requested by the uder in their command, similar instances will be created and added
to the `ShiftEditDescriptor`.

Step 3. A `ShiftEditCommand` with the `ShiftEditDescriptor` and the index of the `Shift` of interest is returned and executed,
setting the edited shift within the model. This results in the replacement of the `Shift` object within the model with a newly
created `Shift` object based on the new attributes.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates this editing process (as per the example).

![Edit Shift Sequence Diagram](images/EditShiftSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ShiftEditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Should there be other information to be edited as requested by the user, there will be other objects created besides `ShiftDay`.
</div>

### Unavailability feature

The unavailability feature allows users to add unavailable timings to a `Worker`, which comprise a day and/or a time.
The setting prevents workers from being assigned to shift slots that they are unavailable for.

#### Implementation

The proposed mechanism is facilitated by `ParserUtil` and the existing system for adding and editing workers.

#### Unavailability

Unavailability is represented by an `Unavailability` class. Since a worker's unavailable timings are only relevant
in the context of existing shift slots, `Unavailability` contains a `ShiftDay` and a `ShiftTime`.

![Unavailability Class Diagram](images/UnavailabilityClassDiagram.png)

Instances of `Unavailability` can be created on 2 occasions:

1. During a `worker-add` command, prefixed with `u/`
2. During a `worker-edit` command, prefixed with `u/`

To increase the efficiency of adding a worker's unavailable timings, users may type `u/UNAVAILABILITY_DAY` to indicate a full-day unavailability 
instead of typing `u/UNAVAILABILITY_DAY AM` and `u/UNAVAILABILITY_DAY PM` separately. Functionality has been added to support the creation
of an AM `Unavailability` and a PM `Unavailability` when `u/UNAVAILABILITY_DAY` is entered. The `ParserUtil` class supports this during parsing through:

- `ParserUtil#parseUnavailability()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses a String and creates a valid `Unavailability` object
- `ParserUtil#createMorningUnavailabilityString()`â€‰â€”â€‰Generates a String of the format `UNAVAILABILITY_DAY AM`
- `ParserUtil#createAfternoonUnavailabilityString()`â€‰â€”â€‰Generates a String of the format `UNAVAILABILITY_DAY PM`
- `ParserUtil#parseUnavailabilities()`â€‰â€”â€‰Iterates through a collection of Strings and creates an `Unavailability`
object for each

#### Example usage scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the unavailability feature behaves at each step after the user has
launched the application.

Step 1. The user executes a `worker-add` command `worker-add ... u/Mon`. `McSchedulerParser` creates a
`WorkerAddCommandParser` and calls the `WorkerAddCommandParser#parse()` method.

Step 2. Within `WorkerAddCommandParser#parse()`, `ParserUtil#parseUnavailabilities()` is called to generate an
`Unavailability` set from the given `u/Mon` field. `ParserUtil#parseUnavailabilities()` checks whether
the input contains only 1 keyword. In this case, since only 1 keyword (i.e. `Mon`) is present, `ParserUtil#createMorningUnavailabilityString()`
is called to generate a `Mon AM` String and `ParserUtil#createAfternoonUnavailabilityString()` is called to generate a `Mon PM`
String. Inside `ParserUtil#parseUnavailabilities()`, `ParserUtil#parseUnavailability()` is called on both Strings
and 2 valid `Unavailability` objects are created, before being added to the returnable `Unavailability` set.

Step 3. The `Unavailability` set is passed into the constructor of the `Worker` class to instantiate a `Worker` object
with the unavailable timings `Mon AM` and `Mon PM`.

The following sequence diagram shows how unavailable timings are added to a `Worker`.

![Unavailability Sequence Diagram](images/AddUnavailabilitySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `WorkerAddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Assign/unassign feature

The assign/unassign feature allows the user to assign/unassign a worker to/from a role in a shift.

#### Implementation

This mechanism is facilitated by adding/deleting `Assignment` objects in the `McScheduler`. Each `Assignment` object
stores a `Shift`, `Worker` and `Role` object. The `McScheduler` maintains a `UniqueAssignmentList`, which enforces
uniqueness between `Assignment` objects by comparing them using `Assignment#isSameAssignment(Assignment)`.

![AssignmentClassDiagram](images/AssignmentClassDiagram.png)

The operations supporting the adding/deleting of `Assignment` objects are exposed in the `Model` interface as
`Model#addAssignment(Assignment)` and `Model#deleteAssignment(Assignment)`.

#### Example usage scenario

Step 1. The user executes `assign s/1 w/1 Cashier` to assign the 1st worker the role of a cashier in the 1st shift in
the McScheduler. `McSchedulerParser` creates an `AssignCommandParser` and calls the `AssignCommandParser#parse()` method.

Step 2. The fields `s/` and `w/` are parsed by the `AssignCommandParser`. A `shiftIndex` and `Set<WorkerRolePair>`
object are created respectively and passed as arguments into the `AssignCommand` constructor. The created `AssignCommand`
is executed in the `LogicManager` by calling the `AssignCommand#execute()` method.

Step 3. During the execution of the `AssignCommand`, an `Assignment` object, storing the 1st `Shift`, 1st `Worker` and cashier
`Role` objects, is created. The `Assignment` object is then added to the `UniqueAssignmentList` in the `Model`.

![AssignSequenceDiagram](images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AssignCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 4. The user realises the previous command was a mistake and executes `unassign s/1 w/1` to unassign the 1st worker
from the 1st shift in the McScheduler. The `unassign` command recreates the `Assignment` object to be deleted and uses it
 as an identifier to identify the `assignment` to be deleted from the `UniqueAssignmentList` in the `Model`.

### Role feature

The role feature allows users to add roles to a `Worker` and add `RoleRequirement` to a `Shift`. When assigning a `Worker` to a `Shift` under a particular `Role`,
we check that the `Worker` has the corresponding `Role` tagged to the `Worker` as the `Role` in the `RoleRequirement` of the particular `Shift`.

#### Implementation

The `Role` constructor takes in a `String` and creates a `Role` object with the according `roleName`. When tagging a `Worker` with a `Role`, we check that the `Role` is an allowed `Role` by checking if it exists in the 
`UniqueRoleList` of the McScheduler.

![RoleClassDiagram](images/RoleClassDiagram.png)

#### Commands
The following commands have been implemented to work with `Role`:
- `RoleAddCommand` to add new roles to `UniqueRoleList`
- `RoleDeleteCommand` to delete existing roles in `UniqueRoleList`
- `RoleListCommand` to list existing roles in `UniqueRoleList`

#### Example usage scenario

Step 1. The user executes `role-add Cashier` to add the cashier role to the `UniqueRoleList` in the McScheduler `ModelManager`.
If the role being added already exists in the `UniqueRoleList`, `DuplicateRoleException` is thrown.

![AddRoleSequenceDiagram](images/AddRoleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `RoleAddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


Step 2. The user realises the previous command was a mistake and looks at the Role list to get the index of the cashier role in the `UniqueRoleList`.
Using the role index in the `UniqueRoleList`, the user executes `role-delete ROLE_INDEX` to remove the cashier role from the `UniqueRoleList`.


### Take/cancel leave feature

The take/cancel leave feature allows users to set workers status to leave given a day and time. 
The setting prevents workers from being allocated to a work shift for which they are taking leave.

#### Implementation

The proposed mechanism to indicate that individuals are on leave makes use of the existing system for assigning workers
to shifts with a particular role. By making use of the existing assignment system, certain conflicts can be avoided:

- Assignment of a worker to a shift when they took leave for that shift will not result in two assignments to the same shift.

##### Leave

Leave is represented as an extension of `Role`. To prevent conflicts between `new Leave()` and `new Role("Leave")`,
these two objects are deemed equivalent through `Leave#equals()` and `Role#equals()`. This implementation should
be reconsidered if there should be a significant difference between these two objects.

![Leave Class Diagram](images/LeaveClassDiagram.png)

Due to their similarity, `Leave` objects are initiated using a common factory method as `Role` objects 
through `Role#createRole()`, which will parse the given input as a `Role` or a `Leave` respectively. 
This implementation prevents the creation of a role that has the same name as a leave.

##### Leave Assignment

Assignment makes use of the `Assignment` class features using `Leave` as the role.

##### Commands

Since `Leave` is essentially an extension of the assignment system, commands related to leave are very similar
to commands related to assignments.

- `TakeLeaveCommand` sets workers to take leave for specific shift. It is a wrapper for `AssignCommand` 
and `ReassignCommand`, depending on if the worker already is assigned for that shift. The following diagram demonstrates how this works.

![TakeLeaveCommand Sequence Diagram](images/LeaveCommandsSequenceDiagram.png)

- `CancelLeaveCommand` is very similar to `UnassignCommand`. However, there is a need to check if the assignment being
removed represents a leave taken and not a normal role assignment. Hence, `CancelLeaveCommand` is implemented
separately and not as a wrapper. However, its implementation details is almost identical to `UnassignCommand`.

For more information, see [Implementation for Assign/Unassign Feature](#assignunassign-feature).

##### Mass Operation Commands

To increase the convenience of use for our expected typist user, we introduced a few mass operations related to leave:

- `TakeLeaveCommand` and `CancelLeaveCommand` both allow for many worker to one shift leave assignment similar to 
`AssignCommand` and `UnassignCommand`.
- `MassTakeLeaveCommand` and `MassCancelLeaveCommand` allow for one worker to many shift leave assignment.
  - These two mass commands allow for taking leave over a range of dates - similar to how leave is often planned 
  by workers.
  - These two commands do not require `Shift`s representing the datetime range to take leave to be present. A bare-bones 
  `Shift` with only `ShiftDate` and `ShiftTime` will be initialised for each `Shift` that has no identity equivalent 
  (via `Shift#isSameShift()`) `Shift` present in the McScheduler.
  - The two commands handle other `Assignment`s differently:
    - `MassTakeLeaveCommand` informs the user after the command is complete if the worker is already scheduled for a shift 
  (i.e. a non-leave `Assignment`). The `Assignment` is replaced to indicate the leave taken.
    - `MassCancelLeaveCommand` searches for leaves in the datetime range and ignores non-leaves.
    
The following activity diagram describes the process behind `MassTakeLeaveCommand`.

![MassTakeLeaveCommand Activity Diagram](images/MassTakeLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

##### Future Extensions - Leave Quota

The following leave quotas could be implemented, possibly using the existing `RoleRequirement` class:

- Quota of leave per worker
- Quota of leave per shift


### MassOps Feature
For certain commands that will be frequently used (`assign`, `unassign`, `take-leave`, `cancel-leave`), mass
operations are supported to reduce the required number of command calls.
 
#### Implementation
These operations consist of their own `*Command` class and `*CommandParser` class. In each of the supported 
`*CommandParser class`, mass operations uses the `ArgumentMultimap#getAllValues(Prefix)` method, which parses the 
user input and returns all values that start with the specific prefix. In this case, the prefix is 'w/', 
signifying a `Worker`-`Role` relation.

Once the Command object has its `shiftIndex` and Set of `WorkerRole`, it creates individual `Assignment`s and adds
them to the Model.


![Class Diagram of AssignCommand, highlighting its MassOps](images/MassAssignClassDiagram.png)

#### Example usage scenario
Let's say that the manager has a new Shift, and requires 3 of their existing staff members to work on 
that shift immediately.

Step 1. The manager creates a new Shift through the `shift-add` command if it was not already done.

Step 2. The manager calls `assign` to assign the 3 existing Workers to the Shift. 
eg. `assign s/8 w/2 Cashier w/3 Fry Cook w/7 Janitor` to assign Workers 2, 3, and 7 to the Role of Cashier, Fry Cook, 
and Janitor respectively to Shift 8.

Step 3. McScheduler parses the input and creates 3 `Assignment`s, which are then added to the `Model`:
* Shift 8, Worker 2, Cashier
* Shift 8, Worker 3, Fry Cook
* Shift 8, Worker 7, Janitor

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is a McDonald's shift manager in Singapore
* manages a significant number of worker contacts
* manages a large number of work shifts
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: McScheduler is a one-stop solution for McDonald's shift managers to manage shift scheduling, as
well as worker contacts and compensation. All relevant information is easily available to help streamline the management
process. It is also easy for the manager to contact workers, and manage their hours and pay. McScheduler aims to be faster than a
typical mouse/GUI driven app for fast typists.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 workers and 1000 shifts without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Should be able to save up to 1000 workers and 1000 shifts worth of data that persists over sessions.
4.  Data should be saved after every change.
5.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
6.  A fresh new user should be able to figure out how to use the app easily.

### Glossary

* **Role**: A position that a worker is able to fill based on their skill set (e.g Cashier, Cleaner, Burger Flipper)
* **Assignment**: A shift and role allocation to a particular worker, where the worker is given a particular role in the particular shift (e.g. An assignment can involve a worker A, who is a Chef in shift B)
* **Unavailability**: A particular day and time (e.g. "Monday AM") where a particular worker is unavailable for work on a recurring basis (e.g. A worker whose unavailability is "Monday AM" is unavailable for work _every_ Monday morning)
* **Leave**: A worker's day-off, where the worker will not be available for work for that particular day 
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS
* **Service Rating**: A rating given based on how well the worker performs at their work
